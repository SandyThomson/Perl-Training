t you’ve seen so far is the core of Perl, the part that you as a Perl user should
understand. But there are many other techniques that, while not obligatory, are still
valuable tools to have in your toolbox. We’ve gathered the most important of those for
this chapter. This also segues into the continuation of this book, Intermediate Perl,
which is your next step in Perl.
Don’t be misled by the title of the chapter, though; the techniques here aren’t especially
more difficult to understand than those that you’ve already seen. They are “advanced”
merely in the sense that they aren’t necessary for beginners. The first time you read this
book, you may want to skip (or skim) this chapter so you can get right to using Perl.
Come back to it a month or two later, when you’re ready to get even more out of Perl.
Consider this entire chapter a huge footnote.1
